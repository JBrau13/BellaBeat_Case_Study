### [Project](BellaBeat%20Case%20Study.pptx)

For this project, we were given FitBit data from a sample of around 30 people over a two week period. This included data such as steps, activity minutes, and sleep duration. We were then asked to analyze this data for trends in the fitness wearable industry and to use our insights to make recommendations to BellaBeat, a competing fitness wearable company. 

### Skills Demonstrated
